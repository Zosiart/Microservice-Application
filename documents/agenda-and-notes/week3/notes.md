### Q&A
* What types of relations for certificates should we accomodate?
  Boat type and certificates are equivalent
* Do we need a system to verify certificates?
  No need to verify certificates
* Should users be able to view activities that they cant apply to?
  It's okay if they can see them as long as they can't apply to them
* No skill level is needed for training activities
* Upload assignment at least a day before Tuesday meetings
* No need to push new activities, we can rely on the user to pull them whenever they want
* Notifications should happen in real time (ex. email)
* What types of filters should we accomodate?
  Gender & organization are fixed attributes
* The users should see all future activities
* We do not need to keep a list of organizations. We just keep them as a String
* Editing activities should be a Could/Should
* No need to have admins
* Add more could haves. The requirements should be more balanced
* Requirement enginering should contains both the requirements that are specified in the assignment as well as new ones that we derive as a team
* Certificates types should be a could have
* Create a context map
* Discuss why certain contexts are core/generic, how did we identify them & how are they mapped to micro-services
